INTELLIGENT PLATFORM MANAGEMENT INTERFACE


Each cluster is equipped with Serial Over LAN connectivity features via
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) allowing for complete
management of each node at any power state. This provides accessibility
to the system while powered off, through boot cycles, and during live
operation. In order to utilize these features, you must first create a
user and enable it on each device. Below are the steps for creating a
new user and some of the common commands you may wish to utilize at
different stages of your clusters operation.


# Create and Enable IPMI User

Remotely connect via ssh to the public IP of one of your nodes (refer to
the equipment register in your portal for system IP addresses).

    ssh root@172.31.2.112
    ipmitool user list

The above command will show all of the currently defined users and ID
slots available for creating additional users. Next, you need to set the
username and password.

    ipmitool user set name 10 "mynewuser"
    ipmitool user set password 10 "p@ssw0rd"
    ipmitool user enable 10
    ipmitool channel setaccess 1 10 privilege=4


# Open Serial Over LAN Session

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd -I lanplus sol activate


# Deactivate Serial Over LAN Session

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd -I lanplus sol
    deactivate


# Power Status of Host

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd chassis power status


# Power On the Host

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd chassis power on


# Power Off the Host

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd chassis power off


# Power Cycle the Host

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd chassis power cycle


# Shut Down the Host Gracefully

    ipmitool -H <hostname or ip> -U mynewuser -P p@ssw0rd chassis power soft


# Identify Node (will blink an orange light on the front of the chassis per "interval" in seconds)

    ipmitool chassis identify <interval>


# Changing BMC from DHCP to Static IPs

    If the need to change BMC from DHCP to a static IP address scheme arises, follow these steps on each node:

_Single node example:_

    ssh root@172.31.2.112
    ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc static
    ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr 192.168.0.100
    ipmitool lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0
    ipmitool lan set 1 defgw ipaddr 192.168.0.1
